## First Impressions

The lab scenario is based on an attacker exploiting **LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning**.

Okay, at first I didn't even know what is LLMNR or NBT-NS... Nothing a bit of research skills can't fix though! I looked it up and:

- **LLMNR** = Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution. fallback DNS when DNS fails. noisy, insecure, broadcast-based.
- **NBT-NS** = NetBIOS Name Service. same vibe but older. Windows uses it when they can't resolve names.

This tells me the attack is very old school but I guess still viable in sloppy networks? From my research on the topic, I get that attackers love those because ANY host on the subnet can reply. Creds are sent in NTLM challenge/response, the attacker fakes being the server and snatches the NTLMv2 hashes. If creds are caught, we should see NTLMv2 auth blobs in SMB/HTTP after poisoned resolution. Once hackers steal the hashes they can try to crack it offline or possibly relay it?

## Lab Setup and Tools Used

Artifact provided: a PCAP file with suspicious network traffic.

Tools used:

- **Wireshark**: to filter around the PCAP file
- Some detective üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è work in sorting packets by time to follow the attacker's steps

### Q1: Mistyped Query from 192.168.232.162 {#q1-mistyped-query-from-192168232162}

I filtered on:

```sql
ip.src == 192.168.232.162 && (udp.port == 5355 || udp.port == 137)
```

This shows the queries sent by that host, and this narrows down to LLMNR (5355) and NBT-NS (137) queries from that host.
I'm looking in the info column for something that sounds off...
Fount it! The one that stands out is:

**Answer:** `fileshaare` ‚úÖ

### Q2: Rogue Machine IP Address {#q2-rogue-machine-ip-address}

To see who's responding to the fake queries, I filtered on:

```sql
udp.port == 137 || udp.port == 5355
```

The rogue consistently responded with poisoned replies:

**Answer:** `192.168.232.215` ‚úÖ

---

### Q3: Second Affected Machine {#q3-second-affected-machine}

Tracked outbound traffic from the rogue with:

```sql
ip.src == 192.168.232.215
```

I sorted by Time column and the first victim was "192.168.232.162" as expected, but then the second one receiving poisoned responses was:

**Answer:** `192.168.232.176` ‚úÖ

---

### Q4: Compromised Username {#q4-compromised-username}

After the poisoned resolution, victims try to authenticate and their NTLM data leaks. So, I filtered with:

```sql
ntlmssp
```

The filter revealed the NTLM negotiation, including the username in the **Info** Column:

**Answer:** `janesmith` ‚úÖ

---

### Q5: Host Accessed via SMB {#q5-host-accessed-via-smb}

Looking for SMB traffic to the rogue machine:

```sql
smb2 && ip.dst == 192.168.232.215
```

To be honest this one was a bit new to me, but after some research, I found SMB2 Session Setup Response with Target Info containing the DNS computer name:

```txt
AccountingPC.cybercactus.local
```

**Answer:** `ACCOUNTINGPC` ‚úÖ

---

## Key Takeaways

- I actually learned what Attacks like **LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning** even are.

---

## What I'd Do Next

- Add a Group Policy to disable **LLMNR and NBT-NS** across the environment.
- Enforce SMB signing to prevent relay.
- Monitor for anomalous LLMNR/NBT-NS traffic (Just in case).
